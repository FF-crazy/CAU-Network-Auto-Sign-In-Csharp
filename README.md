# CAU Network Auto Sign-In (C#)

This repository provides a simple console application that performs an automatic sign-in request to a network portal. It was rewritten in C# based on the Kotlin implementation.

## Usage

1. Set the environment variables `CAU_USERNAME` and `CAU_PASSWORD` with your credentials.
2. Build the project with a C# compiler or open it in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the program. It will attempt to send a POST request to the sign-in endpoint.

The sign-in URL in `Program.cs` is a placeholder (`https://example.com/login`). Update it to the actual CAU network login endpoint.
